MuscularFeatures:==========================================1. The scene is organized into layers for easy management so you can easily hide or isolate individual systems. All components are correctly named & grouped appropriately in the scene.2. The Brain's outer Cerebrum extends to the inner halves to end at the Corpus Callosum. So you can remove 1 half of the brain to show the internals.3. Internal details of the Brain modeled as actual 3D components & fitted together nicely in an easy to understand manner. 4. The Cerebrum is color coded into the 4 lobes: Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital. A single color version is also included ( hidden ).5. Detailed Nervous System consisting of the Central Nervous System, Peripheral Nervous System, & Autonomic Nervous System. 6. Detailed Spine correctly depicts the Cervical Vertebrae ( C1  C7 ), Thoracic Vertebrae ( T1 - T12 ),  Lumbar Vertebrae ( L1 - L5 ) & Intervertebral Discs.7. Detailed Spinal Ligament consisting of the Anterior & Posterior Longitudinal, Intertransverse, Facet Capsular, Interspinous, Supraspinous, Ligamentum Flavum & Nuchal Ligaments.8.

The Cardiovascular system is color coded blue & red to distinguish between vein & artery. Heart pumping is achieved by animating a single Heart Bone.10. A sample animation is included in the scene to demonstrate the possible poses & motions that can be achieved using the rig.11. A PDF document is included to explain how to correctly use the Model.12. Model contains mostly 4 sided polygons for efficiency & modeled to real world scale.13. Two transparent human models are included free, ( with / without male reproductive organ ) to give a sense of the organ's location, without cluttering the important details inside. 14. Detailed & textured muscular system that attaches seamlessly to the skeletal model. The muscles are true 3d objects that can be select and hidden to reveal the internal anatomy inside.15. Optimized subdivision cage gives smooth edges even in high definition. The user only need to crank up the subdivision to get a high poly & detail mesh for rendering, OR crank down the subdivision for a low poly mesh while animating. ==========================================No special plugins needed.Just load and animate!MotionCow is the publisher of high quality photorealistic 3D Models & we proudly stand behind all our products.
